                            <p>I loved that I was very close to all amenities that I require. The banks were nearby, shopping mall not too far and the distance to the CBD is so short you can even walk there if you wanted to. <br><br> I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and family and stay here again whenever I'm around. It's a 9/10 for me, and the extra point is just for improvement coz everything was wonderful.</p>
