# AirBnB_clone

## Project Description

This project is an Airbnb clone implemented in Python, focusing on creating a command-line interface (CLI) for managing and interacting with various classes.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter, implemented using the `cmd` module, provides a set of commands to interact with different classes, including creating, updating, and querying instances.

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, run the following command:

```bash
./console.py
```

### How to Use

The command interpreter supports the following commands:

```
create BaseModel
```

```
show BaseModel 1234-5678
```

```
destroy BaseModel 1234-5678
```

```
all
all BaseModel
```


### How to Test

To test the project, you can run the included unit tests. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and run:

```
python -m unittest discover tests
```


This README provides a brief overview of the project, instructions on how to start and use the command interpreter, and examples demonstrating its functionality.
